Experiment 2: **Determination of Standard Plate Count (SPC) in natural and/or processed foods.**

**1.Story Outline:**

The standard plate count (SPC) is an estimation of bacterial populations in most types of food products. It is a recommended application for detecting sources of contamination by testing line-samples taken at successive stages in the processing. The test employs taking samples from food products where contamination is to be detected. Samples are diluted in saline/peptone water. The dilutions are inoculated on media plates and ithe plates incubated. The colony that develops on the plate is presumed to have grown from one bacterium or clump of bacteria in the inoculums. The total number of colonies counted on the plates multiplied by the dilution factor represents the number of viable micro-organisms present in the sample tested.

**2.Story:**

The process involves preparing media. The media and glasswares are sterilized. The media transferred to laminar flow after sterilization and poured on plates. The plates are than inoculated with samples. The inoculated

**2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:**

The process involves preparing platecount agar media. The media and glasswares are sterilized. The media transferred to laminar flow after sterilization and poured on plates. The plates are than inoculated with samples. The inoculated plates incubated at 28 degree Celsius for 7 days. The plates are later analysed for the no. of colonies. In the experiment the user will be able to see a prototype of the sterilization process. The glasswares are washed under clean water and dried in a hot air oven. The media is rehydrated and dissolved by the action of heat on a hot plate. The media and glasswares are autoclaved. And in the next step the glasswares and media are transferred to laminar air flow.

**2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:**

1. What is the composition of plate count agar?

2. What is standard plate count used for?

3. How will SPC detect contamination of foods?

**2.5Allow pitfalls:**

If the user does not follow proper procedure. The steps will not take place.

**2.6 Conclusion:**

Assessment/evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user and marks should also be assigned.
