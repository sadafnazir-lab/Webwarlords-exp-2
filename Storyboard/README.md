Experiment 2: **Determination of Standard Plate Count (SPC) in natural and/or processed foods.**

**1.Story Outline:**

The standard plate count (SPC) is an estimation of bacterial populations in most types of food products. It is a recommended application for detecting sources of contamination by testing line-samples taken at successive stages in the processing. The test employs taking samples from food products where contamination is to be detected. Samples are diluted in saline/peptone water. The dilutions are inoculated on media plates and ithe plates incubated. The colony that develops on the plate is presumed to have grown from one bacterium or clump of bacteria in the inoculums. The total number of colonies counted on the plates multiplied by the dilution factor represents the number of viable micro-organisms present in the sample tested.

**2.Story:**

The process involves preparing media. The media and glasswares are sterilized. The media transferred to laminar flow after sterilization and poured on plates. The plates are than inoculated with samples. The inoculated

**2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:**

The process involves preparing platecount agar media. The media and glasswares are sterilized. The media transferred to laminar flow after sterilization and poured on plates. The plates are than inoculated with samples. The inoculated plates incubated at 28 degree Celsius for 7 days. The plates are later analysed for the no. of colonies.

**2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:**

1. The simulator gives a visual display of contaminated food, swab, inoculation needle, autoclave, Laminar air flow Click on the &#39;simulation tab&#39; Perform experiment

2. To prepare media, glassware and media should be selected Click to rehydrate media To prepare media

3. Place the media and glassware in autoclave for sterilization Click on autoclave to open and set time temperature To sterilize

4. Remove after sterlization Click on laminar air flow to transfer the sterilized glassware and media. Unwrap and pour media To complete sterilization

5. Take swab from contaminated samples Click on contaminated samples to take a swab and place the swab in saline/petone water To take microbial samples

6. Pour plating/streak plating Click on petriplates to streak or pour For inculation of sample

7. Incubate and interpret results Click on incubator to incubate and set temp. And read results by counting colonies after set duration To complete SPC

**2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:**

1. What is the composition of plate count agar?

2. What is standard plate count used for?

3. How will SPC detect contamination of foods?

**2.5Allow pitfalls:**

Choosing the wrong glassware will spill the media during its preparation.

Not wrapping the glass ware and media in foil may cause breakage to glassware

Not wrapping the glass ware and media will also lead contamination on petriplates

Not sanitizing the laminar air flow will cause contamination plates.

**2.6 Conclusion:**

Assessment/evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user and marks should also be assigned.

**2.7 Equations/formulas: NA**

cfu/ml = (no. of colonies x dilution factor) / volume of culture plate
