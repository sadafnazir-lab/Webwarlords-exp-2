The standard plate count (SPC) is suitable for estimating bacterial populations in most types of natural and processed foodproducts. This procedure is also recommended for application in detecting sources of contamination by testing line-samples taken at successive stages in the processing.The test employs serial dilution technique for easy quantification of the micro-organisms. The appropriate dilutions of the food sample are mixed with a sterile nutrient medium that can support the growth of the micro-organisms, when incubated at a suitable temperature. Each bacterial colony that develops on the plate is presumed to have grown from one bacterium or clump of bacteria in the inoculums. The total number of colonies counted on the plates multiplied by the dilution factor to represent the number of viable micro-organisms present in the sample tested.
