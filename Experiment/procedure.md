2. Dilute 1ml of a sample by withdrawing 1ml of the sample and dispencing this 1ml sample into the first dilution tube

3. Using the same procedure, withdraw 1ml from first dilution tube and dispense into the second dilution tube. Subsequently withdraw 1ml from second dilution tube and dispense into the third dilution tube. Continue doing this from tube to tube until the dilution is completed.

4. Transfer 1ml from each of only the last three dilution tubes onto the surface of the corresponding agar plates

5.Incubate the agar plates at 37Â°C for 48 hours.

6. Choose the plate that appears to have between 30 and 300 colonies.

7. Count the extract number of colonies on that plate.
