# **1.Aim**

Determination of Standard Plate Count (SPC) in natural and/or processed foods.

# **2.Theory**

The standard plate count (SPC) is suitable for estimating bacterial populations in most types of natural and processed foodproducts. This procedure is also recommended for application in detecting sources of contamination by testing line-samples taken at successive stages in the processing.The test employs serial dilution technique for easy quantification of the micro-organisms. The appropriate dilutions of the food sample are mixed with a sterile nutrient medium that can support the growth of the micro-organisms, when incubated at a suitable temperature. Each bacterial colony that develops on the plate is presumed to have grown from one bacterium or clump of bacteria in the inoculums. The total number of colonies counted on the plates multiplied by the dilution factor to represent the number of viable micro-organisms present in the sample tested.

# **3.Procedure**

1. Take 6 dilution tubes, each containing 9ml of starile saline.

2. Dilute 1ml of a sample by withdrawing 1ml of the sample and dispencing this 1ml sample into the first dilution tube

3. Using the same procedure, withdraw 1ml from first dilution tube and dispense into the second dilution tube. Subsequently withdraw 1ml from second dilution tube and dispense into the third dilution tube. Continue doing this from tube to tube until the dilution is completed.

4. Transfer 1ml from each of only the last three dilution tubes onto the surface of the corresponding agar plates

5.Incubate the agar plates at 37°C for 48 hours.

6. Choose the plate that appears to have between 30 and 300 colonies.

7. Count the extract number of colonies on that plate.

8. Calculate the number of CFU&#39;s per ml of original sample as follows:
